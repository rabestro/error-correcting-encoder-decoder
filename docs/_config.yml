  Errors are inevitable both in life and in the digital world. 
  Errors occur here and there and everywhere, and in this project 
  you will not only imitate this process, but also learn how to 
  cope with errors. It is a chance to experience what early 
  developers had to cope with at the dawn of the computer era. 
  Low-level programming is fun and insightful: try it and you’ll see.
