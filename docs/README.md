## About

Errors are inevitable both in life and in the digital world. Errors occur here and there and everywhere, and in this
project we will not only imitate this process, but also learn how to cope with errors. It is a chance to experience what
early developers had to cope with at the dawn of the computer era. Low-level programming is fun and insightful: try it
and youâ€™ll see.

## Learning outcomes

Gain a more profound understanding of essential basics and figure out bytes bit by bit. Practice loops and working with
files.
